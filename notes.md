notes for midterm and final
git pull, git push, git commit will keep things updated between repos

Getting in to my amazon instance: ssh -i ~/Downloads/production.pem ubuntu@54.204.10.112

public ip address: 54.204.10.112

domain name: tiffanycs260.click

git pull, git push, git commit will update all of the changes

git status shows differences between the clones and commits missed. if you have something committed to github and not your repo, git pull will sync them up

./deployFiles.sh -k ~/Downloads/production.pem -h tiffanycs260.click -s simon
this is to deploy to production
